        **GeoS4** is an innovative tool for transforming geographic patterns into musical compositions. 
        By mapping spatial information onto a sequencer grid, you can create unique rhythmic 
        patterns that reflect the characteristics of different geographic locations from multiple perspectives.

        ### üéØ How it works:

        1. **üó∫Ô∏è Create Spatial Patterns**: Choose any city in the world or use our random country generator
        2. **üìç Select Data Sources**: Pick between real amenities (restaurants, shops, etc.) or random points
        3. **üîß Apply Transformations**: Modify the spatial data with clustering, grid alignment, or noise (ranges up to 5km)
        4. **üìö Organize with Data Layers**: Group and manage multiple spatial patterns
        5. **üéµ Create Music**: Points are mapped to a drum sequencer where each spatial zone becomes a musical track
        6. **üéöÔ∏è Customize Audio**: Upload your own sounds or use built-in drum samples
        7. **üìº Record Your Creations**: Capture your performances with the built-in recording tool

        ## üìö Understanding Data Layers

        **Data Layers** are the core organizational system in GeoS4. Think of them as musical "albums" that contain one or more geographic patterns from different cities or regions.

        ### What are Data Layers?

        - **Container System**: Each layer can hold multiple spatial patterns from different locations
        - **Musical Units**: Layers become the foundation for your sequencer compositions
        - **Combination Tool**: Merge patterns from multiple cities into unified musical experiences
        - **Workflow Organization**: Keep related geographic explorations together

        ### Layer Workflow:

        #### Step 1: Create Spatial Patterns
        - Go to **"Create Spatial Pattern"** tab
        - Generate patterns for any city (e.g., "Manhattan, New York" or "Venice, Italy")
        - Experiment with different data sources and transformations
        - Each pattern represents one geographic dataset

        #### Step 2: Build Data Layers  
        - **Create New Layer**: Start fresh with a single pattern
        - **Add to Existing Layer**: Combine multiple patterns (e.g., "European Cities" layer with Rome + Paris + Barcelona)
        - **Layer Benefits**: 
          - Unified sequencer experience across multiple cities
          - Preserved individual boundary shapes
          - Complex rhythmic interactions between different urban patterns

        #### Step 3: Use Layers in Sequencer
        - Go to **"Data Layers"** tab to select your layer
        - Click **"Play"** to automatically load it into the sequencer
        - Or manually select layers from the **"Play!"** tab

        ### Layer Examples:

        **Single City Layer**: "Manhattan Restaurants"
        - One pattern: Restaurant locations in Manhattan
        - Simple, focused musical representation

        **Multi-City Layer**: "Mediterranean Coastal Cities"  
        - Pattern 1: Barcelona cafes
        - Pattern 2: Venice restaurants  
        - Pattern 3: Naples shops
        - Rich, complex musical combination

        **Themed Layer**: "University Towns"
        - Pattern 1: Cambridge, UK - Academic amenities
        - Pattern 2: Bologna, Italy - Student areas
        - Pattern 3: Berkeley, USA - Campus facilities
        - Comparative geographic music analysis

        ### Advanced Layer Features:

        #### Geographic Union Processing
        - **Boundary Preservation**: Multiple city boundaries remain distinct in visualizations
        - **Point Consolidation**: All geographic points combine into a unified dataset
        - **Adaptive Grids**: Sequencer automatically adjusts to accommodate merged spatial data
        - **Smart Mapping**: Points maintain their geographic relationships across grid changes

        #### Musical Benefits
        - **Layered Complexity**: Multiple cities create richer rhythmic patterns
        - **Spatial Relationships**: Geographic proximity influences musical timing
        - **Cultural Patterns**: Different urban planning styles become audible
        - **Scalable Compositions**: From single neighborhood to entire regions
