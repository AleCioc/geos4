- **Processes spatial information** through mathematical transformations (clustering, grid alignment, noise)
- **Maps coordinates to an adaptive drum sequencer** where each geographic point becomes a potential sound trigger
- **Supports custom audio uploads** for personalized soundscapes
- **Records high-quality audio** of your geographic musical performances
- **Creates complex multi-city compositions** by combining patterns from different locations
